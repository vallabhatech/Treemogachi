# 🌱 GrowVana  
**Grow a digital tree by doing real-world good deeds.**  
Your actions feed life — both on-screen and on Earth.

---

## 🌟 Inspiration  
We wanted to build something that felt alive — not just another gamified checklist.  
A tree that grows with your kindness felt poetic, grounding, and motivating.  
If you help the planet, the planet gives life back. Simple. Beautiful. Honest.

---

## 🌿 What It Does  
GrowVana turns sustainability into a game:

- Perform real-world eco-friendly actions  
- Log them inside the app  
- AI validates how genuine and impactful the action is  
- Your virtual tree grows from a seed → sprout → plant → tree → fruit-bearing beauty  

The more good you do, the more alive your tree becomes.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

### **Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Tailwind CSS for styling  
- Framer Motion for animations  
- Soft visuals inspired by *Dumb Ways to Die*

### **Backend**
- Node.js  
- Firebase (Auth + Realtime DB / Firestore)

### **AI Integration**
- OpenAI / Gemini APIs  
- NLP-based scoring model that checks if an action is truly eco-friendly  

### **Design**
- Stage-based tree animations (seed → fruit tree)  
- Calming, minimal but emotionally warm UI

## ⚔️ Challenges We Ran Into
- Getting AI to distinguish real eco-actions from filler text  
- Making tree-growth animations feel emotionally connected to progress  
- Balancing minimalism with engagement  
- Designing a scoring system that doesn’t feel like a chore

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments We’re Proud Of
- Built a fully functional prototype that turns sustainability into joy  
- Created an AI evaluator for environmental actions  
- Designed animations people actually get attached to  
- Shipped a clean, peaceful interface that feels alive

## 💡 What We Learned
- Small aesthetic decisions can change emotional impact  
- AI can be used responsibly to motivate good behavior  
- Nature-themed progress feels way more meaningful than points or badges
